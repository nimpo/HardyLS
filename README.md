# HardyLS
Font similar to that painted on the side of Hardy's Well, a pub in Manchester.

This font was created, based on the rendering of the poem "Hardy's Well", written by Lemn Sissay painted on the side of the Hardy's Well Pub. The original painting, I understand, was done by the then landlady Melanie Pemberton.
This font was then used for a different alliterative poem written by Mike Jones in 2019 and superimposed on a GIMP'ed image of Hardy's Well. The original image of Hardy's Well used was that posted to Flickr by Tim Green (atoash).
The poem written by Mike Jones was then rendered as an animation and posted to Youtube: https://youtu.be/FBDMlvZZDkI
